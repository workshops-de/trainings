# Dockerfile

In this training you will create your own image and run it afterwards.

## Inspect the Dockerfile

## Build the image

```bash
docker build -t my-image:1.0.0 .
```

The instruction `-t my-image:1.0.0` defines the name and the version of the resulting image.

The instrucition `.` tells the build process the location of the build context.

View the stored images on your host

```bash
docker images
```

## Run a container from the image

```bash
docker run -it my-image:1.0.0
```

## Cleanup

```bash
docker rm -f $(docker ps -qa)
```
