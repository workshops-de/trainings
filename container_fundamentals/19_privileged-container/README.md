# Privileged Container

In this course we will get full access to the host.

## Check processes in a container

```bash
docker run -it --rm ubuntu:20.04 ps aux
```

Note that you see only the process of the container.

## Check the processes of a privileged container

```bash
docker run -it --rm --privileged --pid host ubuntu:20.04 ps aux
```

Note that you see all processes of the host.

## Check the filesystem of a privileged container

```bash
docker run -it --rm --privileged -v /:/host ubuntu:20.04 ls -alh /host
```

Note that you see the filesystem of the host.
